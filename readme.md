Applied for 1 day extension on July 17th
* Used svg and png image files and SVGLoader.java distributed in-class.
* For eyebrows and eyes in the middle part (avatar), user has to click right on the black parts (colored pixels)
* For eyebrows and eyes in the left part (accordion), user doesn't have to click specifically on the colored pixels (setPickOnBounds implemented)
* Choose "Background" as my own feature (to set a transparent background, in the color picker click the "custom color" option to set the opacity of the chosen color to 0)
* The background color is random at the beginning. It also has the hover and click highlight effects. 
* The hover effect is InnerShadow red. The select effect is InnerShadow blue.
